## Project Tasks
1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Handling missing values.
    - Removing or handling outliers.
    - Ensuring correct data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Analyzing the distribution of terrorist attacks over the years.
    - Identifying the most affected countries.
    - Investigating the types of attacks and their frequency.
    - Determining the most common targets of terrorist attacks.
    - Analyzing the trends in casualties over time.

3. **Data Visualization**:
    - Creating plots to visualize trends and distributions.
    - Using geographical maps to show the impact of terrorism across different regions.
    - Creating interactive visualizations using Plotly.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
    - Summarizing the key findings.
    - Providing actionable insights based on the analysis.
